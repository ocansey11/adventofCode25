# D. Flip the Signs

**Time limit per test:** 1 second  
**Memory limit per test:** 256 megabytes

## Problem Statement

Given an array `a` consisting of `n` elements, find the maximum possible sum the array can have after performing the following operation any number of times:

* Choose 2 adjacent elements and flip both of their signs. In other words, choose an index `i` such that 1 ≤ i ≤ n−1 and assign a[i] = −a[i] and a[i+1] = −a[i+1].

## Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10⁵) — the length of the array.

The following line contains `n` space-separated integers a₁, a₂, …, aₙ (−10⁹ ≤ aᵢ ≤ 10⁹).

It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10⁵.

## Output

For each test case, output the maximum possible sum the array can have after performing the described operation any number of times.

## Example

### Input
```
5
3
-1 -1 -1
5
1 5 -5 0 2
3
1 2 3
6
-1 10 9 8 7 6
2
-1 -1
```

### Output
```
1
13
6
39
2
```

## Notes

**Test case 1:** By performing the operation on the first two elements, we can change the array from [−1, −1, −1] to [1, 1, −1], and it can be proven this array obtains the maximum possible sum which is 1 + 1 + (−1) = 1.

**Test case 2:** By performing the operation on −5 and 0, we change the array from [1, 5, −5, 0, 2] to [1, 5, −(−5), −0, 2] = [1, 5, 5, 0, 2], which has the maximum sum since all elements are non-negative. So, the answer is 1 + 5 + 5 + 0 + 2 = 13.

**Test case 3:** The array already contains only positive numbers, so performing operations is unnecessary. The answer is just the sum of the whole array, which is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
